## 🚀 Join the Weaver Journey: Call for Community Volunteers & Roadmap Reveal

**Hello, Weaver Community!**

First, a massive thank you to everyone for your enthusiasm and PR contributions. It is because of you that Weaver continues to iterate and evolve so rapidly. Thanks to the simplicity and accessibility of the **Go language**, we’ve seen a non-stop stream of high-quality PRs!

Weaver is growing much faster than we anticipated. As we are currently in the midst of the **Chinese New Year holiday**, we are looking to recruit community volunteers to help us maintain this incredible momentum.

This document outlines the specific volunteer roles we need right now and provides a look at our upcoming **Roadmap**.

### 🎁 Community Perks

To show our appreciation, developers who officially join our community operations will receive:

* **Exclusive AI Hardware:** Our upcoming, unreleased AI device.
* **Token Discounts:** Potential discounts on LLM tokens (currently in negotiations with major providers).

### 🎥 Calling All Content Creators!

Not a developer? You can still help! We welcome users to post **Weaver reviews or tutorials**.

* **Twitter:** Use the tag **#weaver** and mention **@SipeedIO**.
* **Bilibili:** Mention **@Sipeed矽速科技** or send us a DM.
We will be rewarding high-quality content creators with the same perks as our community developers!

## 🛠️ Urgent Volunteer Roles

We are looking for experts in the following areas:

1. **Issue/PR Reviewers**
* **The Mission:** With PRs and Issues exploding in volume, we need help with initial triage, evaluation, and merging.
* **Focus:** Preliminary merging and community health. Efficiency optimization and security audits will be handled by specialized roles.


2. **Resource Optimization Experts**
* **The Mission:** Rapid growth has introduced dependencies that are making Weaver a bit "heavy." We want to keep it lean.
* **Focus:** Analyzing resource growth between releases and trimming redundancy.
* **Priority:** **RAM usage optimization** > Binary size reduction.


3. **Security Audit & Bug Fixes**
* **The Mission:** Due to the "vibe coding" nature of our early stages, we need a thorough review of network security and AI permission management.
* **Focus:** Auditing the codebase for vulnerabilities and implementing robust fixes.


4. **Documentation & DX (Developer Experience)**
* **The Mission:** Our current README is a bit outdated. We need "step-by-step" guides that even beginners can follow.
* **Focus:** Creating clear, user-friendly documentation for both setup and development.


5. **AI-Powered CI/CD Optimization**
* **The Mission:** Weaver started as a "vibe coding" experiment; now we want to use AI to manage it.
* **Focus:** Automating builds with AI and exploring AI-driven issue resolution.

**How to Apply:** > If you are interested in any of the roles above, please send an email to support@sipeed.com with the subject line: [Apply: Weaver Expert Volunteer] + Your Desired Role.   
Please include a brief introduction and any relevant experience or portfolio links. We will review all applications and grant project permissions to selected contributors!

Interested in a specific feature? You can "claim" these tasks and start building:

### 
* **Provider:** 
  * **Provider Refactor:** Currently being handled by **@Daming** (ETA: 5 days)
  * You can still submit code; Daming will merge it into the new implementation.
* **Channels:** 
  * Support for OneBot, additional platforms
  * attachments (images, audio, video, files).
* **Skills:** 
  * Implementing `find_skill` to discover tools via [openclaw/skills](https://github.com/openclaw/skills) and other platforms.
* **Operations:** * MCP Support.
  * Android operations (e.g., botdrop).
  * Browser automation via CDP or ActionBook.


* **Multi-Agent Ecosystem:**
  * **Basic Model-Agnet** S
  * **Model Routing:** Small models for easy tasks, large models for hard ones (to save tokens).
  * **Swarm Mode.**
  * **AIEOS Integration.**


* **Branding:** 
  * **Logo**: We need a cute logo! We’re leaning toward a **Mantis Shrimp**—small, but packs a legendary punch!


We have officially created these tasks as GitHub Issues, all marked with the roadmap tag.   
This list will be updated continuously as we progress.   
If you would like to claim a task, please feel free to start a conversation by commenting directly on the corresponding issue!
